## Research Experience

- **Software Engineer for SUIT Project**, Inter-University Centre of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India
  - June 2023 - Present
  - SUIT - Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope is a telescope on-board the Aditya-L1 mission by India to study the Sun.
  - Developed the complete data pipeline to convert the binary data received from the satellite to a science-ready product. The pipeline receives binary data packets (~100Gb) from Indian Space Science Data Centre and converts them to science-ready products and sends back the data within 24 hours.
  - Developed the Quick Look Display software for browsing the data quality and Sun center finder software as feedback information for the ISRO Mission team. Both are deployed at ISRO.
  - Managing all the calibration and science observations during the Payload Verification phase of SUIT.
  - Developed software and tools for fine-tuning the program sequences and parameters of SUIT. These tools are used to finalize the thresholds and parameters in SUIT program sequences.
  - Developed the internal database and query system for SUIT data.
  - Developed the SUIT website and automated upload of outreach products to it. [SUIT Website](https://suit.iucaa.in)
  - Managing the SUIT Payload Operation Center. This includes maintaining the servers and data storage.

- **AstroSat Support Executive for AstroSat Project**, Inter-University Centre of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India
  - February 2023 - May 2023
  - Developed a better algorithm, named Sum-threshold algorithm for Gamma-Ray Burst detection using CZTI data. It is completely automated and still running in CZTI Payload Operation Centre. It has detected more GRBs which were not detected earlier in the sever years of CZTI data.
  - X-ray Polarization analysis using CZTI data. Analyzed the CZTI detected GRBs for polarization and maintained a catalog.

- **Scientific Trainee for AstroSat Project**, Inter-University Centre of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India
  - February 2022 - February 2023
  - [Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI)](http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=home) is an instrument on-board the AstroSat Satellite of India. It is the first Multi-messenger satellite developed by India.
  - Designed and developed a Python module as an interface for users to execute all CZTI modules sequentially. The users can alter any parameter of any module as a command line argument without worrying about other modules.
  - Detected almost 40 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRB) by analyzing CZTI data and reported to GCN Circulars Archive ([Check in ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=title%3A%22AstroSat%20CZTI%20detection%22%20author%3A%22Gopalakrishnan%2C%20R.%22&sort=entry_date%20asc%2C%20bibcode%20asc)).
  - Created light-curves, spectrograms, and Compton light-curves (if total counts are above 4000) for the detected GRBs and uploaded to [AstroSat CZTI GRB archive page](http://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb) of CZTI.
  - Developed a module to detect GRBs in CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector data after noise-cleaning.
  - Performed an analysis to pinpoint the detectability of GRBs in CZTI and presented the results in the AstroSat CZTI Workshop held at IUCAA on September 2022.
  - Contributed to the development of cztpipeline_V3.0, which is the latest software for processing the data received from CZTI payload.
  - Maintained a catalog of the GRBs searched in CZTI payload data.
  - Disabled noisy pixels of CZTI payload which caused any issue in data quality.
  - **Daily tasks:** Create useful science products by processing the raw data received from the Indian Space Science Data Center (ISSDC), monitor the instrument's health, and perform targeted searches for GRBs using the trigger times reported by other instruments.

- **Masters Thesis**, Guide: Dr. Ritam Mallick, Associate Professor, IISER Bhopal, India
  - May 2019 - April 2020
  - **Topic:** From Hydrodynamics to Astrophysics - A Numerical Study
  - Developed an exact numerical solver for Euler's equations.
  - Studied standard hydrodynamic problems like SOD Shock tube problem, Sedov - Blast problem and created hydrodynamic codes to simulate them.
  - Applied the hydrodynamic techniques used in standard problems to simulate a toy supernova case and studied the variation of physical properties.

- **Course Project**, Guide: Dr. Nirmal Ganguly, Assistant Professor, IISER Bhopal, India
  - January 2019 - April 2019
  - **Topic:** Simulating Oscillating Chemical Reaction
  - Created a simulation of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction -- the most famous oscillating chemical reaction.
  - Applied numerical techniques like the Runge-Kutta method, and Newton-Raphson technique.
  - Analyzed the condition and region of periodicity and chaos for the reaction.

- **Reading Project**, Guide: Dr. Surajit Saha, Assistant Professor, IISER Bhopal, India
  - May 2017 - July 2017
  - **Topic:** Introduction to Solid State Physics
  - Engaged in laboratory work during the reading project.
  - Learned basics of solid state physics.
